![Login Page - Screenshot](./screenshots/customer-rep/01-login-page.png)

4. Enter your email and password
5. Click **"Sign In"**

### After Login

Once you log in, you'll land on your **Dashboard**. This is your home base where you can see:
- Your earnings
- Pending orders that need follow-up
- Total orders you've handled
- Your conversion rate

![Rep Dashboard - Screenshot](./screenshots/customer-rep/02-rep-dashboard.png)

**First-time login?** An interactive tour will guide you through the key features. Follow along to learn the basics.

You're all set! No additional setup needed - you can start taking calls and processing orders right away.

---

## 2. Understanding Your Dashboard

Your dashboard is your command center. It shows your performance metrics and helps you track your work.

![Dashboard Overview - Screenshot](./screenshots/customer-rep/03-dashboard-overview.png)

### Your Key Metrics

The dashboard displays 4 important numbers:

#### 1. My Earnings
This shows your **total commission earned this month** in Ghana Cedis (GHS). Your commission is calculated based on successful orders you've processed.

#### 2. My Pending Orders ⚠️
This is the **number of orders waiting for follow-up**. These are orders that need customer confirmation or action from you.

**This is your most important metric!** Pending orders should be followed up quickly to convert them into sales. Check this number regularly throughout the day.

#### 3. My Total Orders
The **total number of orders you've created this month**. This includes all orders regardless of their status (pending, confirmed, delivered, cancelled).

#### 4. My Conversion Rate
The **percentage of your orders that became successful sales**. For example, if you created 100 orders and 75 were delivered, your conversion rate is 75%.

A higher conversion rate means you're doing a great job following up and closing sales!

### Understanding Monthly Data

All metrics reset at the beginning of each month. Your dashboard always shows data for the current month only.

### Navigation Menu

Use the sidebar menu to navigate between different pages:

- **Dashboard** - Your home page (where you are now)
- **Orders** - View and manage all your orders
- **Customers** - Search, add, and manage customer information
- **Settings** - Update your profile and preferences

![Navigation Menu - Screenshot](./screenshots/customer-rep/04-navigation-menu.png)

Simply click on any menu item to switch pages.

---

## 3. Customer Management

Managing customer information correctly is crucial. Accurate customer records help you process orders faster and avoid confusion.

### Accessing the Customers Page

Click **"Customers"** in the sidebar menu to view all your customers.

![Customers Page - Screenshot](./screenshots/customer-rep/05-customers-list.png)

### Searching for Existing Customers

**Always search for a customer before creating a new one!** This prevents duplicate records.

To search:
1. Use the search bar at the top of the Customers page
2. Type the customer's **name** or **phone number**
3. The list will filter to show matching results

![Customer Search - Screenshot](./screenshots/customer-rep/06-customer-search.png)

If you find the customer, click on their name to view their details and order history.

### Adding a New Customer

If the customer doesn't exist in the system:

1. Click the **"Add Customer"** button
2. Fill in the customer information form
3. **Required fields** are marked with an asterisk (*) - you must fill these in
4. Pay special attention to:
   - **Phone number** - Verify this carefully (it's how you'll contact them)
   - **Address** - Get the complete delivery address
   - **Region** - Select from the Ghana regions dropdown
   - **City** - Select the appropriate city

![Add Customer Form - Screenshot](./screenshots/customer-rep/07-add-customer-form.png)

5. Click **"Save"** to create the customer

**Duplicate Warning**: If you try to add a customer that already exists, the system will warn you. In this case, use the existing customer record instead.

### Viewing Customer Details & Order History

Click on any customer's name to see:
- Their complete contact information
- Delivery address
- **All past orders** they've placed

![Customer Details - Screenshot](./screenshots/customer-rep/08-customer-details.png)

This history helps you reference previous orders when talking to repeat customers.

### Editing Customer Information

If a customer's details change (new address, phone number, etc.):

1. Open the customer's detail page
2. Click **"Edit"**
3. Update the necessary fields
4. Click **"Save"**

**Note**: You cannot delete customers - only admins can do this. If you need a customer removed, contact your admin.

### Best Practices

✅ **Always search first** - Check if the customer exists before creating a new record
✅ **Verify phone numbers** - Double-check the number during the call
✅ **Get complete addresses** - Include landmarks or additional directions in the address field
✅ **Update outdated info** - If a customer mentions they moved, update their address immediately

---

## 4. Creating Orders

Creating orders is your main task. Here's how to do it step by step.

### Accessing the Orders Page

Click **"Orders"** in the sidebar menu to view all orders.

![Orders Page - Screenshot](./screenshots/customer-rep/09-orders-list.png)

To create a new order, click the **"Create Order"** button.

### The Create Order Form

When you click "Create Order", you'll see a form with several fields. **Required fields** are marked with an asterisk (*).

![Create Order Form - Screenshot](./screenshots/customer-rep/10-create-order-form.png)

### Step-by-Step Order Creation

#### Step 1: Select or Create Customer

At the top of the form, you'll see a **customer selection dropdown**.

- If the customer already exists, search and select their name
- If they're new, you can create them right here by clicking **"Add New Customer"** (no need to leave this page!)

The system will automatically link the order to the customer.

#### Step 2: Add Products

Use the **product dropdown** to select items for the order.

![Product Selection - Screenshot](./screenshots/customer-rep/11-product-selection.png)

- Click **"Add Product"**
- Select the product from the dropdown
- You'll see the **product price** displayed automatically
- **You can modify the price** if needed (discounts, promotions, etc.)
- Enter the **quantity**

**Multiple Products**: You can add multiple products to one order! Just click "Add Product" again to add another item.

![Multiple Products - Screenshot](./screenshots/customer-rep/12-multiple-products.png)

#### Step 3: Enter Delivery Address

Even if the customer exists in the system, **you must enter the delivery address for this specific order**.

Fill in:
- Street address
- City (select from dropdown)
- Region (select from dropdown)
- Any landmarks or special directions

**Tip**: Always verify the delivery address with the customer during the call. Don't assume their address hasn't changed!

#### Step 4: Add Order Notes (Optional)

If there are special instructions or important details, add them in the **"Order Notes"** field:
- "Customer prefers delivery after 5pm"
- "Call before delivery"
- "Fragile items - handle with care"

#### Step 5: Review and Submit

- **Payment Method**: All orders are Cash-on-Delivery (COD) - you don't need to select anything
- Double-check all details (address, products, quantities)
- Click **"Create Order"**

### After Creating the Order

Once you click "Create Order":

1. The order is saved with status **"Pending Confirmation"**
2. It appears in your **Orders table**
3. It adds to your **"My Pending Orders"** count on the dashboard

**Important**: The order is now waiting for follow-up! See [Section 5: Following Up on Pending Orders](#5-following-up-on-pending-orders) to learn what to do next.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Not verifying the delivery address** - Always confirm with the customer
❌ **Skipping order notes** - Add important details so delivery agents know what to expect
❌ **Wrong quantities** - Double-check how many items the customer wants
❌ **Forgetting to follow up** - Creating the order is just the first step!

### Best Practices

✅ **Read back the order** - Before hanging up, confirm all details with the customer
✅ **Be specific with addresses** - Include landmarks like "Near the yellow church" or "Opposite the school"
✅ **Note customer preferences** - Use the notes field for anything that helps fulfill the order correctly
✅ **Follow up immediately** - Don't let orders sit in pending status (more on this in Section 5!)

## 5. Following Up on Pending Orders

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR JOB!** 🚨

Following up on pending orders is what separates great reps from average ones. Your conversion rate, earnings, and success depend on this.

### Why This Matters

When you create an order, it starts with status **"Pending Confirmation"**. This means:
- The customer hasn't officially confirmed they want it
- The order won't be processed until you follow up
- **You don't earn commission** until the order is delivered

**Every pending order sitting in your list is potential money you're losing!**

Your pending orders directly affect:
- ❌ Your conversion rate (lower rate = poor performance)
- ❌ Your earnings (no confirmation = no delivery = no commission)
- ❌ Customer satisfaction (delays frustrate customers)

### The 1-Hour Rule ⏰

**Follow up within 1 HOUR of creating the order!**

The faster you follow up, the more likely the customer will confirm. If you wait too long:
- Customer loses interest
- Customer orders from a competitor
- Customer forgets they even requested the order

### Finding Your Pending Orders

On the **Orders page**, click the **"Pending"** filter tab to see all orders waiting for follow-up.

![Pending Orders Filter - Screenshot](./screenshots/customer-rep/13-pending-orders-filter.png)

**Pro tip**: Check this list multiple times throughout the day. Make it part of your hourly routine!

### What "Follow Up" Means

Following up means:
1. **Calling the customer** to confirm they still want the order
2. **Convincing them to commit** if they're hesitant
3. **Updating the order status** based on the outcome

### Step-by-Step: Making a Follow-Up Call

#### 1. Open the Order Details

Click on the pending order to see all the details.

![Order Details Page - Screenshot](./screenshots/customer-rep/14-order-details.png)

Review:
- Customer name and phone number
- Products they ordered
- Delivery address
- Any notes from the original call

#### 2. Call the Customer

Use the phone number on file to call them.

**During the call:**
- Confirm their name
- Remind them of the order details (products, quantity, total price)
- Confirm their delivery address
- Answer any questions they have
- **Convince them to take the order** if they seem unsure

#### 3. Log the Call

After the call, **always log it in the system** so there's a record.

![Log Call - Screenshot](./screenshots/customer-rep/15-log-call.png)

Click **"Log Call"** and add:
- Date and time of call
- Brief notes about what happened
- Whether you reached them or not

### Three Possible Outcomes

After calling, one of three things will happen:

#### ✅ Outcome 1: Customer Confirms

**The customer says YES, they want the order!**

**What to do:**
1. Thank them and confirm delivery details
2. Change the order status to **"Confirmed"** (see [Section 6: Updating Order Status](#6-updating-order-status))
3. The order now moves forward in the fulfillment process
4. You're one step closer to earning commission!

#### ❌ Outcome 2: Customer Declines

**The customer says NO, they don't want the order anymore.**

**What to do:**
1. Ask politely why they changed their mind (helps you improve)
2. Change the order status to **"Cancelled"** (see [Section 7: Handling Cancelled Orders](#7-handling-cancelled-orders))
3. Log the reason in your call notes
4. Move on to the next pending order

**Don't take it personally!** Cancellations happen. Focus on the next opportunity.

#### 📞 Outcome 3: Customer Doesn't Answer

**The customer doesn't pick up your call.**

**What to do:**
1. Log that you attempted to call
2. **Leave the order as "Pending"**
3. Try calling again later the same day (maybe they're busy)
4. If they still don't answer, try again over the next few days
5. **Don't give up after one attempt!**

### How Many Times Should You Call?

**Multiple times!** Many successful orders happen on the 2nd or 3rd call attempt.

**Best approach:**
- **Day 1**: Call 2-3 times at different times (morning, afternoon, evening)
- **Day 2-3**: Call once per day
- **After 3-4 days**: If still no answer, consider cancelling (but log all attempts first)

Different customers have different schedules. Be persistent!

### Tips for Convincing Hesitant Customers

Sometimes customers are unsure. Here's how to help them commit:

✅ **Remind them of benefits** - Why they wanted the product in the first place
✅ **Address concerns** - If they mention price, delivery time, or quality concerns, address them directly
✅ **Create urgency** - "We have limited stock" or "This promotion ends soon"
✅ **Be confident** - Your enthusiasm is contagious! Believe in the product
✅ **Offer solutions** - If delivery address is an issue, ask if there's an alternate location
✅ **Build trust** - Reassure them about COD payment (they pay when they receive it)

### Daily Routine for Managing Pending Orders

Make this your habit:

**Morning (Start of shift):**
- Check your "My Pending Orders" count on the dashboard
- Filter and review all pending orders
- Prioritize orders from yesterday that need follow-up

**Throughout the day:**
- Follow up on new orders within 1 hour of creating them
- Call back customers who didn't answer earlier

**End of shift:**
- Review any pending orders that still need attention
- Make notes for tomorrow's follow-ups

### The Bottom Line

**Pending orders = potential earnings sitting idle.**

The faster you convert pending orders to confirmed orders, the more money you make and the better your performance metrics. Don't let orders sit in pending status!

**Make following up your #1 priority every single day.**

## 6. Updating Order Status

As a customer rep, you're responsible for managing orders through their entire lifecycle - from creation to delivery. Keeping order statuses accurate and up-to-date is essential.

### Understanding Order Statuses

Every order goes through a series of statuses as it moves from creation to delivery:

```
pending_confirmation → confirmed → preparing → ready_for_pickup
→ out_for_delivery → delivered
```

**You can also branch to:**
- `cancelled` - Customer doesn't want the order
- `returned` - Customer returns the order after delivery
- `failed_delivery` - Delivery attempt unsuccessful

### What Each Status Means

| Status | What It Means | When to Use It |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **pending_confirmation** | Order created, waiting for customer to confirm | Automatically set when you create an order |
| **confirmed** | Customer confirmed they want the order | After successful follow-up call |
| **preparing** | Order is being prepared/packed for delivery | When you or warehouse team starts preparing items |
| **ready_for_pickup** | Order is packed and ready for delivery agent | When order is fully prepared and ready to go |
| **out_for_delivery** | Delivery agent has the order and is on the way | When delivery agent picks up and leaves for delivery |
| **delivered** | Customer received the order and paid | After successful delivery and payment collection |
| **cancelled** | Order was cancelled | Customer declined or order couldn't be fulfilled |
| **returned** | Customer returned the order after delivery | When a delivered order comes back |
| **failed_delivery** | Delivery attempt failed | Customer wasn't home, wrong address, etc. |

### How to Update Order Status

#### Step 1: Open the Order

Go to the **Orders page** and click on the order you want to update.

![Order Detail Page - Screenshot](./screenshots/customer-rep/16-order-detail-status.png)

#### Step 2: Change the Status

On the order detail page, you'll see a **Status dropdown** at the top.

1. Click on the current status dropdown
2. Select the new status from the list
3. (Optional but recommended) Add notes explaining the status change
4. Click **"Update"** or the status will save automatically

![Update Status Dropdown - Screenshot](./screenshots/customer-rep/17-update-status-dropdown.png)

The status change happens immediately. You can also refresh the page to see the update.

### Common Status Updates You'll Make

#### After Follow-Up Call → Change to "Confirmed"

When a customer confirms they want the order:
1. Open the order
2. Change status from `pending_confirmation` → `confirmed`
3. Add note: "Customer confirmed via phone call"

#### When Preparing the Order → Change to "Preparing"

When you or the team starts preparing the items:
1. Change status from `confirmed` → `preparing`
2. Add note about what's being prepared

#### When Order is Ready → Change to "Ready for Pickup"

When everything is packed and ready:
1. Change status from `preparing` → `ready_for_pickup`
2. Add note if there are special handling instructions

#### When Going Out for Delivery → Change to "Out for Delivery"

When you or a delivery agent takes the order for delivery:
1. Change status from `ready_for_pickup` → `out_for_delivery`
2. Add note with delivery agent name or vehicle details

#### After Successful Delivery → Change to "Delivered"

When the customer receives the order and pays:
1. Change status from `out_for_delivery` → `delivered`
2. Add note confirming payment received
3. **This is when you earn your commission!** 💰

### Adding Notes to Status Changes

When you update a status, there's a notes field where you can add context.

**Good examples:**
- "Customer confirmed order, delivery address verified"
- "Preparing 3 items, will be ready by 2pm"
- "Out for delivery with John, customer expects delivery after 5pm"
- "Delivered successfully, customer paid GHS 250 cash"

Adding notes helps everyone track what's happening and provides a clear record.

### No Restrictions

You have full control over order statuses:
- ✅ You can change to **any status** at any time
- ✅ You can move backwards if needed (e.g., confirmed back to pending)
- ✅ You can skip steps if necessary

This flexibility helps you handle real-world situations. Just make sure the status accurately reflects reality!

### Real-Time Updates

Status changes appear immediately in the system. If you update an order:
- The change shows up instantly
- Other reps can see the update in real-time
- You can also refresh the page to confirm the change

### Why Accurate Status Tracking Matters

Keeping statuses current is important because:

✅ **Customer trust** - Accurate tracking shows professionalism
✅ **Team coordination** - Everyone knows where each order stands
✅ **Performance tracking** - Your metrics depend on accurate statuses
✅ **Commission calculation** - You only earn when orders reach "delivered"
✅ **Problem solving** - Easy to spot stuck orders or issues

### Best Practices

✅ **Update immediately** - Don't wait. Change status as soon as something happens
✅ **Be accurate** - The status should reflect the real situation
✅ **Add notes** - Include helpful context for yourself and the team
✅ **Check regularly** - Review your orders throughout the day and keep them current
✅ **Move orders forward** - Your goal is to get orders from pending → delivered as fast as possible

---

## 7. Handling Cancelled Orders

Sometimes orders need to be cancelled. This section explains when and how to cancel orders properly.

### What Is a Cancellation?

A cancelled order is one that won't be fulfilled or delivered. The customer won't receive the product and no payment will be collected.

**Important**: Since all orders are Cash-on-Delivery (COD), cancellations happen before payment. There are no refunds involved in cancellations - that's for returns (see [Section 8: Handling Returns](#8-handling-returns)).

### When Can Orders Be Cancelled?

Orders can be cancelled at **any status**:
- ✅ `pending_confirmation` - Most common
- ✅ `confirmed` - Customer changed their mind
- ✅ `preparing` - Before items are packed
- ✅ `ready_for_pickup` - Before delivery starts
- ✅ `out_for_delivery` - Even if already with delivery agent
- ✅ Any other status

You have full flexibility to cancel when needed.

### Who Can Cancel Orders?

- **Any rep** can cancel any order (not just the one who created it)
- **Customers** can request cancellations by calling in
- **Admins/Managers** can also cancel orders

### Two Cancellation Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Customer Requests Cancellation

Customer calls and says they don't want the order anymore.

**What to do:**
1. Ask why they want to cancel (helps improve service)
2. Try to address their concerns if possible (wrong address? we can update it!)
3. If they still want to cancel, confirm you'll cancel it
4. Open the order and change status to `cancelled`
5. Add detailed notes about the reason

#### Scenario 2: You Decide to Cancel

After multiple failed attempts to reach the customer, or other valid reasons.

**What to do:**
1. **First, try to call the customer** to confirm they want to cancel
2. If they confirm, proceed with cancellation
3. If they're still unreachable after many attempts (see [Section 5](#5-following-up-on-pending-orders) for guidance), you can cancel
4. Change status to `cancelled`
5. Add detailed notes explaining why

### How to Cancel an Order

#### Step 1: Open the Order

Go to the **Orders page** and open the order you need to cancel.

#### Step 2: Change Status to Cancelled

1. Click the **Status dropdown**
2. Select **"Cancelled"**
3. **Add notes** - This is mandatory! Explain why the order was cancelled

**Good cancellation notes:**
- "Customer called and changed mind, said product no longer needed"
- "Wrong delivery address, customer not in that city anymore"
- "Customer unreachable after 5 call attempts over 3 days"
- "Out of stock - product unavailable"
- "Customer didn't pick up product at delivery location after multiple attempts"

4. Save the status change

The order is now cancelled and won't be processed further.

### Common Cancellation Reasons

| Reason | Description | When It Happens |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Customer changed mind** | No longer wants the product | After follow-up call |
| **Customer unreachable** | Multiple call attempts failed | After 3-5 days of trying |
| **Wrong address** | Delivery address incorrect/invalid | During verification |
| **Out of stock** | Product not available | During preparation |
| **Customer not picking up** | Product delivered to location but customer won't collect | After delivery attempt |
| **Duplicate order** | Same order created twice by mistake | After review |
| **Customer requested cancellation** | Customer called to cancel | Anytime |

### Impact on Your Performance

Cancellations affect you:

❌ **Lower conversion rate** - Cancelled orders count against your success rate
❌ **No commission** - You don't earn anything on cancelled orders
❌ **Wasted time** - Time spent on the order doesn't generate income

**That's why following up quickly matters!** The faster you confirm orders, the fewer cancellations you'll have.

### Restocking Prepared Items

If an order was already being prepared or packed:
1. Note in the cancellation that items need restocking
2. Inform the warehouse/inventory team
3. Items will be returned to inventory

Example note: "Cancelled - customer unreachable. 3 items prepared, need restocking."

### Reopening Cancelled Orders

**Customer changed their mind again?** You can reactivate a cancelled order!

1. Open the cancelled order
2. Change status back to `pending_confirmation` or `confirmed`
3. Add note: "Customer called back, wants to proceed with order"
4. Continue with normal order processing

This is much faster than creating a brand new order.

### When to Cancel vs Keep Trying

**Keep trying when:**
- ✅ Order is still `pending_confirmation` and it's been less than 3 days
- ✅ Customer asked for more time to decide
- ✅ You've only tried calling once or twice
- ✅ There's a simple fix to the problem (wrong address, pricing question)

**Cancel when:**
- ❌ Customer explicitly says they don't want it
- ❌ Customer unreachable after multiple attempts over several days
- ❌ Address is invalid and customer won't provide a correct one
- ❌ Product is out of stock with no restock date
- ❌ Customer refuses to pick up product after it's been delivered to pickup location

**Rule of thumb**: Don't cancel too quickly! Exhaust your follow-up attempts first (see [Section 5](#5-following-up-on-pending-orders)).

### Best Practices for Minimizing Cancellations

✅ **Follow up within 1 hour** - Strike while the customer is still interested
✅ **Call multiple times** - Don't give up after one attempt
✅ **Verify addresses carefully** - Wrong addresses lead to cancellations
✅ **Address concerns immediately** - If customer is hesitant, work with them
✅ **Confirm availability** - Don't create orders for out-of-stock items
✅ **Be professional** - Good service reduces cancellation requests
✅ **Document everything** - Clear notes help everyone understand what happened

### Remember

Cancellations are part of the job - they happen. Don't take them personally! Focus on:
- Minimizing cancellations through quick follow-up
- Documenting the reason clearly
- Learning from patterns (are certain products getting cancelled more? why?)
- Moving forward to the next order

---

## 8. Handling Returns

Returns happen when a customer wants to send back a product they've already received and paid for. This is different from cancellations.

### Cancellation vs Return: What's the Difference?

| | **Cancellation** | **Return** |
|---|---|---|
| **When?** | Before delivery | After delivery |
| **Payment?** | Before customer pays | After customer has paid |
| **Refund?** | No refund needed (no payment made) | Refund required |
| **Who initiates?** | Rep or customer | Customer only |
| **Status used** | `cancelled` | `returned` |

**Key point**: If the customer hasn't received or paid for the product yet, it's a cancellation (see [Section 7](#7-handling-cancelled-orders)). If they already have the product and paid, it's a return.

### Return Policy

Customers can return products under these conditions:

✅ **Within 30 days** of delivery
✅ **Product must be unopened/unused**
✅ **Original packaging intact**

If these conditions aren't met, returns may not be approved.

### Common Return Reasons

Customers request returns for various reasons:

- **Defective product** - Product damaged or doesn't work properly
- **Wrong item delivered** - Received different product than ordered
- **Changed mind** - Customer no longer wants the product
- **Doesn't meet expectations** - Product quality or features not as expected
- **Size/fit issues** - Wrong size (clothing, accessories)

### How to Handle a Return Request

When a customer calls requesting a return, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Listen and Gather Information

1. Let the customer explain why they want to return the product
2. Ask when they received the order
3. Ask about the product condition (opened? used? damaged package?)

#### Step 2: Verify Return Eligibility

Check if the return qualifies:

- ✅ Is it within 30 days of delivery?
- ✅ Is the product unopened/unused?
- ✅ Is the packaging intact?

**If YES to all**: Proceed to Step 3
**If NO to any**: Explain the return policy to the customer. They may not be eligible for a return.

#### Step 3: Explain the Refund Process

Tell the customer:
- "We'll refund you the product cost minus the delivery fee"
- Example: If they paid GHS 100, and delivery was GHS 15, they'll get GHS 85 back
- "A manager needs to approve the return first"
- "Once approved, we'll arrange pickup and process your refund"

#### Step 4: Request Manager Approval

**Important**: You cannot approve returns yourself. Manager approval is required.

1. Open the order in the system
2. Add notes documenting the return request:
   - Return reason
   - Customer's explanation
   - Product condition (unopened/unused)
   - Date of delivery
3. Contact your manager/admin with the order details
4. Wait for manager approval

Example note: "Customer requesting return - product defective (doesn't turn on). Delivered 10 days ago. Product unopened. Requesting manager approval for return."

#### Step 5: Once Approved - Arrange Pickup

After your manager approves:

1. Call the customer to confirm approval
2. Arrange a pickup time with customer
3. Coordinate with delivery team to pick up the item
4. Provide customer's address and contact info to delivery agent

#### Step 6: After Pickup - Update Status

Once the item has been physically picked up and returned:

1. Change the order status to **"Returned"**
2. Add notes: "Item picked up on [date], condition verified, refund processed"
3. Process the refund (cash back to customer)

**Don't change status to "returned" until the item is actually picked up!**

### Refund Calculation

**Refund amount** = Total paid - Delivery fee

**Example:**
- Customer paid: GHS 150 total
- Product cost: GHS 135
- Delivery fee: GHS 15
- **Refund**: GHS 135 (product cost only)

The delivery fee is not refunded because the delivery service was already provided.

### Impact on Your Commission

⚠️ **You lose the commission on returned orders.**

Returns hurt your earnings because:
- ❌ Commission is removed when order status changes to "returned"
- ❌ Your conversion rate drops
- ❌ Time invested doesn't generate income

This is why quality checking and accurate order creation is important - it prevents returns!

### What to Tell Customers

During a return request call, be professional and helpful:

**Good responses:**
- "I understand. Let me help you with that return."
- "Can you tell me what's wrong with the product?"
- "I need to get manager approval for the return. I'll call you back within [timeframe]."
- "Once approved, we'll arrange pickup at your convenience."
- "You'll receive [amount] as a refund - the product cost minus the delivery fee."

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Arguing with the customer about their reason
- ❌ Making promises you can't keep ("I'll approve it right now")
- ❌ Telling them they'll get a full refund including delivery fee

### Best Practices for Minimizing Returns

Returns cost you commission! Here's how to reduce them:

✅ **Verify orders carefully** - Make sure you create the right order (correct products, quantities)
✅ **Confirm product details** - During order creation, describe the product to the customer clearly
✅ **Set accurate expectations** - Don't oversell or misrepresent products
✅ **Double-check addresses** - Wrong deliveries lead to returns
✅ **Quality check before delivery** - If you're handling the product, inspect it first

### Remember

Returns are frustrating because you lose commission, but they're part of COD business. Handle them professionally:

- Be empathetic to customer concerns
- Follow the process (manager approval required)
- Document everything clearly
- Learn from returns to prevent future ones
- Focus on creating quality orders upfront

## 9. Common Workflows

Your day involves two main types of workflows: handling incoming calls from customers (inbound) and following up on orders that come through the website or forms (outbound).

### Workflow 1: Inbound Calls (Customer Calls You)

This is when a customer calls to place an order.

```
Customer calls → Get customer info → Search/create customer → Create order → Follow up
```

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Answer the call**
   - Greet the customer professionally
   - Ask what they'd like to order

2. **Get customer information**
   - Name, phone number, delivery address
   - The customer already knows what product they want

3. **Search for existing customer**
   - Go to Customers page
   - Search by name or phone number
   - If found, use existing customer record
   - If not found, create new customer (see [Section 3](#3-customer-management))

4. **Create the order**
   - Go to Orders page → Click "Create Order"
   - Select the customer
   - Add products they requested
   - Enter delivery address (verify with customer)
   - Add any special notes
   - Submit the order (see [Section 4](#4-creating-orders))

5. **Confirm details with customer**
   - Read back: products, quantities, total price, delivery address
   - Thank them and let them know you'll call back to confirm

6. **Follow up within 1 hour**
   - Call them back to confirm they still want the order
   - Change status to "confirmed" once they confirm (see [Section 5](#5-following-up-on-pending-orders))

**Time**: Most inbound calls take less than 5 minutes from start to finish.

---

### Workflow 2: Outbound Calls (Orders Come From Web/Forms)

This is when orders appear in the system from your website or checkout forms, and you need to call the customer to confirm.

```
Order appears in system → Review details → Call customer → Confirm/update status
```

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Order appears in your system**
   - Orders come from website purchases or checkout form submissions
   - They appear in your Orders list with status "pending_confirmation"

2. **Review the order details**
   - Open the order to see what the customer ordered
   - Note: customer name, phone number, products, delivery address
   - Check if anything looks unusual (invalid address, duplicate order, etc.)

3. **Call the customer**
   - Use the phone number on file
   - Confirm their identity
   - Tell them their order is ready for processing
   - Verify all details: products, quantities, delivery address, total price

4. **Update the order status**
   - If customer confirms: Change status to "confirmed" (see [Section 6](#6-updating-order-status))
   - If customer declines: Cancel the order (see [Section 7](#7-handling-cancelled-orders))
   - If customer doesn't answer: Log the call attempt, try again later (see [Section 5](#5-following-up-on-pending-orders))

5. **Continue processing**
   - Move the order through statuses as needed (preparing → ready → out for delivery → delivered)

**Time**: Most outbound calls take less than 5 minutes.

---

### Your Daily Routine

Here's what a typical day looks like:

#### Morning (Start of Shift)

1. **Check your dashboard**
   - Look at "My Pending Orders" count
   - Review any pending orders from previous days

2. **Filter pending orders**
   - Go to Orders page → Click "Pending" filter
   - Prioritize orders that need follow-up today

3. **Make your first follow-up calls**
   - Start calling customers with pending orders
   - Goal: Convert pending → confirmed

#### Throughout the Day

**Priority 1: Answer incoming calls**
- When a customer calls, answer immediately
- Take their order following the inbound workflow
- Incoming calls are your #1 priority - customers are waiting!

**Priority 2: Handle web/form orders**
- Check for new orders from website/forms
- Call customers to confirm (outbound workflow)

**Priority 3: Follow up on pending orders**
- Between incoming calls, work through your pending list
- Call customers who haven't confirmed yet
- Update statuses as orders progress

**Priority 4: Update order statuses**
- As orders move through fulfillment, keep statuses current
- Mark orders as preparing, ready, out for delivery, delivered

#### End of Day

1. **Review your pending orders**
   - Check how many pending orders remain
   - Note which ones need priority follow-up tomorrow

2. **Update any outstanding statuses**
   - Make sure all completed deliveries are marked "delivered"
   - Add notes for orders that need attention tomorrow

3. **Check your metrics**
   - Look at your dashboard to see today's performance
   - Review conversion rate and earnings

---

### Priority System

When multiple things need attention, follow this order:

**1st Priority: Incoming calls** 📞
- Customer is on the line waiting
- Handle immediately

**2nd Priority: Pending orders** ⏰
- Orders waiting for follow-up
- These are potential lost sales if you delay

**3rd Priority: Administrative tasks** 📝
- Updating statuses, adding notes, reviewing reports
- Important but not as urgent

**Why incoming calls come first**: A customer calling is an active, immediate opportunity. They're interested right now. Pending orders can wait a few more minutes while you help the live caller.

---

### Quick Reference: Workflows at a Glance

| Workflow Type | Trigger | Your Action | Result |
|---------------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Inbound** | Customer calls you | Search/create customer → Create order → Follow up | New pending order |
| **Outbound** | Order from web/form | Call customer → Confirm details → Update status | Confirmed or cancelled order |

---

### Tips for Efficient Workflow Management

✅ **Keep the dashboard open** - Check "My Pending Orders" count regularly
✅ **Use filters** - Filter orders by status to focus on what needs attention
✅ **Work in batches** - If no incoming calls, make 5-10 follow-up calls in a row
✅ **Set reminders** - If customer asks to be called later, note the time
✅ **Stay organized** - Add good notes so you remember context for each order
✅ **Move fast** - Most tasks take under 5 minutes - don't overthink it

Remember: Your goal is to move orders from pending → confirmed → delivered as quickly as possible. The faster you work, the more you earn!

---

## 10. Tips and Best Practices

Here are proven tips to help you succeed as a customer rep and maximize your earnings.

### Phone Communication Tips

Your voice is your primary tool. Make it count:

✅ **Professional greeting** - "Hello, this is [your name] from [company]. How can I help you?"
✅ **Speak clearly** - Don't rush. Enunciate so customers understand every word
✅ **Active listening** - Let customers finish speaking before responding
✅ **Use their name** - "Thanks for your order, Mrs. Mensah" feels more personal
✅ **Smile while talking** - It changes your tone and customers can hear it
✅ **Confirm understanding** - Repeat back important details to avoid mistakes
✅ **End positively** - "Thank you for your order! We'll take good care of you."

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Eating or drinking while on calls
- ❌ Background noise (find a quiet space)
- ❌ Using slang or unprofessional language
- ❌ Rushing the customer off the phone

---

### Time Management

Work smarter, not just harder:

✅ **Batch similar tasks** - Make 10 follow-up calls in a row rather than switching between tasks
✅ **Use filters efficiently** - Filter by "pending" to focus on what needs attention
✅ **Set time blocks** - "9-10am: Follow-up calls, 10-12pm: Take incoming calls & web orders"
✅ **Use downtime wisely** - When no incoming calls, work through pending orders
✅ **Don't overthink** - Most tasks take under 5 minutes. Move fast and trust your judgment
✅ **Track your pace** - Notice how many orders you complete per hour and try to improve

---

### Accuracy is Everything

Mistakes cost time and money:

✅ **Double-check addresses** - Read the full address back to the customer
✅ **Verify phone numbers** - "Your number is 0XX XXX XXXX, correct?"
✅ **Confirm product details** - "You want 2 units of [product name], right?"
✅ **Review before submitting** - Take 10 seconds to scan the order before clicking "Create"
✅ **Use correct spelling** - Misspelled names frustrate customers
✅ **Note special instructions** - If customer mentions anything important, write it down

**One wrong digit in an address = failed delivery = cancelled order = no commission**

---

### Customer Service Excellence

Great service leads to repeat customers:

✅ **Be patient** - Some customers need more time to decide
✅ **Stay empathetic** - "I understand your concern, let me help with that"
✅ **Be solution-focused** - Don't just say "no", offer alternatives
✅ **Own mistakes** - If you made an error, apologize and fix it quickly
✅ **Go the extra mile** - Help customers feel valued
✅ **Stay professional** - Even if a customer is rude, remain calm and courteous

**Happy customers = higher conversion rates = more earnings**

---

### Maximizing Your Earnings

Your income depends on delivered orders. Here's how to maximize it:

✅ **Follow up within 1 hour** - This is the #1 factor in high conversion rates
✅ **Call multiple times** - Don't give up after one attempt
✅ **Reduce cancellations** - Verify details carefully during order creation
✅ **Minimize returns** - Set accurate expectations about products
✅ **Update statuses quickly** - Get orders from pending → delivered faster
✅ **Build rapport** - Customers who like you are more likely to buy
✅ **Track your metrics** - Check your conversion rate daily and aim to improve

**Top performers follow up fast, call persistently, and have high accuracy**

---

### Organization Habits

Stay organized to avoid dropping balls:

✅ **Add detailed notes** - Future-you will thank present-you
✅ **Use order filters** - Don't scroll through everything, filter by status
✅ **Create a system** - Track which customers need callbacks today
✅ **Review pending orders daily** - Make it a morning ritual
✅ **Keep customer records updated** - If they mention a new phone number or address, update it
✅ **Log every call** - Document your attempts so there's a record

---

### Dealing with Difficult Customers

Not every call goes smoothly. Stay professional:

✅ **Stay calm** - Don't match their energy if they're upset
✅ **Listen first** - Let them vent before offering solutions
✅ **Don't take it personally** - They're frustrated with the situation, not you
✅ **Acknowledge feelings** - "I understand this is frustrating"
✅ **Focus on solutions** - "Here's what I can do to help..."
✅ **Know when to escalate** - If you can't resolve it, involve your manager

**Remember**: Even difficult customers can become loyal ones if you handle them well.

---

### Handling Rejection

Cancellations and rejections are part of the job:

✅ **Expect some rejection** - Not every order will convert. That's normal
✅ **Don't take it personally** - Customer circumstances change
✅ **Learn from it** - If multiple customers cancel for the same reason, note the pattern
✅ **Move forward quickly** - Don't dwell on one cancelled order
✅ **Focus on what you control** - You can't force customers to buy, but you can follow up quickly

**Top reps have 70-80% conversion rates, meaning 20-30% of their orders don't work out. That's expected!**

---

### Success Habits of Top Performers

Here's what the best reps do differently:

1. **Check pending orders first thing** every morning
2. **Follow up on new orders within 30-60 minutes** (not hours)
3. **Call customers 2-3 times** before giving up
4. **Add detailed notes** on every call and status change
5. **Review their metrics daily** and set improvement goals
6. **Ask for help** when they're unsure
7. **Stay positive** even when facing cancellations
8. **Build relationships** with repeat customers
9. **Keep learning** and adapting their approach
10. **Celebrate wins** - Every delivered order is a success!

---

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

Learn from common pitfalls:

❌ **Not following up fast enough** - Orders go cold after a few hours
❌ **Giving up after one call** - Many successful orders happen on attempt 2 or 3
❌ **Skipping customer verification** - Wrong addresses lead to failed deliveries
❌ **Creating duplicate customers** - Always search first
❌ **Forgetting to log calls** - No record = confusion later
❌ **Poor note-taking** - Future-you needs context
❌ **Not updating statuses** - Stale data hurts everyone
❌ **Taking rejection personally** - It's just business

---

### Daily Success Checklist

Use this checklist to stay consistent:

**Morning:**
- [ ] Log into the system

- [ ] Review pending orders from yesterday
- [ ] Make first 5-10 follow-up calls

### Tracking Your Improvement

Monitor these metrics to see your progress:

**Set goals**: "This week I'll improve my conversion rate from 65% to 70%" or "I'll reduce pending orders from 15 to 10"

---

### Building Customer Relationships

Repeat customers are easier sales:

✅ **Remember details** - Check past orders when they call again
✅ **Personalize service** - "Great to hear from you again, Mr. Asante!"
✅ **Reference history** - "Last time you ordered [product], would you like that again?"
✅ **Treat them well** - Excellent service turns one-time buyers into regulars
✅ **Ask for feedback** - "How was your last delivery?" shows you care

**Loyal customers = higher conversion rates = more predictable income**

---

### Final Thoughts

Success as a customer rep comes down to:

1. **Speed** - Follow up fast
2. **Persistence** - Call multiple times
3. **Accuracy** - Get details right the first time
4. **Professionalism** - Treat every customer well
5. **Organization** - Stay on top of your orders

You control your earnings. The more orders you convert and deliver, the more you make. Stay focused, stay positive, and keep improving!

**You've got this! 💪**

## 11. Troubleshooting

Running into issues? Here are solutions to common problems you might encounter.

### Login Issues

**Problem: Can't log in / "Invalid credentials" error**

**Solutions:**
1. Double-check your email and password (check for typos, caps lock)
2. Make sure you're using the correct URL: https://codadminpro.com
3. Contact your admin - only they can reset your password
4. If your account is locked, your admin needs to unlock it

**Remember**: You cannot change your own password. Only admins can do this.

---

### Can't Find a Customer

**Problem: Searching for a customer but they don't appear**

**Solutions:**
1. Check your spelling - try searching by phone number instead of name
2. Try partial search - search "Mensah" instead of "Kwame Mensah"
3. The customer might not exist yet - create a new customer record
4. Try searching without special characters (search "0241234567" not "+233 24 123 4567")
5. Refresh the page and try again

---

### Can't Find an Order

**Problem: Looking for an order but can't see it**

**Solutions:**
1. Check your filters - click "All" to see all orders, not just pending
2. Make sure you're looking at the right date range
3. Try searching by customer name or order number
4. The order might belong to another rep (you only see your own orders)
5. Refresh the page to load latest orders

---

### Order Won't Save or Submit

**Problem: Clicking "Create Order" but nothing happens or you get an error**

**Solutions:**
1. Check for required fields - look for red error messages or asterisks (*)
2. Make sure you selected a customer
3. Verify you added at least one product
4. Check that delivery address is complete
5. Check your internet connection
6. Try refreshing the page and re-entering the order

**Required fields reminder**: Customer, at least one product, delivery address

---

### Status Update Not Working

**Problem: Changed order status but it's not updating**

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh the page - sometimes updates need a manual refresh
2. Check if you saved the change (look for a "Save" or "Update" button)
3. Make sure you have permission to update that order
4. Try logging out and back in
5. If still not working, contact your admin

---

### Dashboard Metrics Not Updating

**Problem: Dashboard numbers seem wrong or outdated**

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh the page - metrics should update in real-time but manual refresh helps
2. Remember: Dashboard shows current month only (resets at the start of each month)
3. Check if you're looking at the right metric (Pending vs Total Orders)
4. Wait a few seconds - sometimes there's a small delay
5. If numbers are way off, contact your admin

---

### Duplicate Customer Warning

**Problem: System says customer already exists when trying to create one**

**Solutions:**
1. This is working correctly! The system is preventing duplicates
2. Cancel the customer creation
3. Search for the existing customer using their name or phone number
4. Use the existing customer record for your order
5. If you truly need a new record (maybe same name, different person), contact your admin

**Don't create duplicates** - it causes confusion and data issues.

---

### Wrong Product Added to Order

**Problem: Added the wrong product to an order**

**Solutions:**

**If order not yet submitted:**
1. Remove the wrong product
2. Add the correct product
3. Submit the order

**If order already submitted:**
1. Open the order
2. You may be able to edit it if it's still in "pending" or "confirmed" status
3. If you can't edit, contact your admin
4. Alternatively: Cancel the wrong order and create a new correct one

---

### Customer Unreachable

**Problem: Customer won't answer calls, tried multiple times**

**Solutions:**
1. Try calling at different times of day (morning, afternoon, evening)
2. Spread calls over multiple days (Day 1: 2-3 calls, Day 2-3: 1 call each day)
3. Log every call attempt with date and time
4. After 3-5 days with no response, consider cancelling the order
5. Document the reason: "Customer unreachable after [X] call attempts over [Y] days"

See [Section 5: Following Up on Pending Orders](#5-following-up-on-pending-orders) for detailed guidance.

---

### System Running Slow

**Problem: Pages loading slowly or system is laggy**

**Solutions:**
1. Close unnecessary browser tabs
2. Clear your browser cache:
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
   - Firefox: Settings → Privacy → Clear Data
3. Check your internet connection
4. Try using a different browser (Chrome recommended)
5. Restart your browser
6. Restart your computer if very slow

---

### Page Not Loading

**Problem: Page is blank, stuck loading, or showing an error**

**Solutions:**

4. Try logging out and back in
5. Try a different browser
6. Contact your admin if the issue persists

---

### Search Not Finding Results

**Problem: Searching but getting no results when you know the item exists**

**Solutions:**
1. Check your spelling
2. Try searching with less text (search "Accra" instead of "Accra, Greater Accra Region")
3. Try searching by different fields (phone number instead of name)
4. Clear any active filters
5. Refresh the page and try again
6. Make sure you're searching in the right section (Customers page for customers, Orders page for orders)

---

### Filter Not Working

**Problem: Applied a filter but results don't match**

**Solutions:**
1. Clear all filters and reapply the one you want
2. Refresh the page
3. Check if you accidentally have multiple filters active
4. Try clicking "All" first, then applying your filter
5. Some filters work together - make sure your combination makes sense

---

### Real-Time Updates Delayed

**Problem: Made a change but other reps or pages don't show it immediately**

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh the page - most updates appear instantly, but manual refresh ensures you see them
2. Wait 5-10 seconds - sometimes there's a small delay
3. Check your internet connection
4. If delays persist, contact your admin (might be a system issue)

---
